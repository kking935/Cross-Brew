## Overview

Hey my name's Ken King and in this video I'll be giving a brief demo of Vector Rideshare's new University Management System, UniDash

UniDash provides authorized university administrators with a simple, seamless way to monitor and moderate the Vector Rideshare network at their university.

In this demonstration, I'll walk you though how you can use UniDash to view, edit, and delete students and groups from your university network.

To log into the platform, sign in with your university's administrative Vector Rideshare account.
  
  For the sake of the this presentation, I will use a pretend administrative account for Penn State University.

    email: admin@psu.edu
    password: Password

Upon loggin in, you'll be directed to the student dashboard page.

On this page, you can view all of the students signed up for Vector Rideshare under your university.

You can also see each student's trip privileges as indicated by the icons to the right of their name.

To see more details about a specific student, you can click on their banner to open up a complete overview of their account.

On this page, you can view information like the student's college id, university email, community ratings, and more.

If you click on the actions dropdown, you also have the option to suspend or enable the student's rider and driver privileges, and you can also remove the student from your network if so choose.

I'll now show an example of enabling some students' rider and driver privileges, suspending some students privileges, and removing one student from the university network.

Now that I've shown you how you can manage and monitor students within your university network, now I'll show you how to manage the groups within your university network as well.

If you click on the Groups button in the top right corner of the page, you'll be directed to the Groups dashboard.

On this page, you can view all of the groups signed up for Vector Rideshare under your university.

To see more details about a specific group, you can click on their banner to open up a complete overview of their account.

On this page, you can view the all of the students that are members of this group.

If you click on the actions dropdown, you also have the option to remove the group from your network if so choose.

I'll now show an example of removing a group from the university network.

And it's as simple as that!

Aside from everything I've just mentioned, it's also worth noting that UniDash is 100% mobile friendly and also comes with a built-in dark mode for convenience late at night.

As you can see, UniDash is a simple yet powerful way for universities to gain control of their network and establish the infrastructure to create the best rideshare platform for their campus and their community.

I hope you consider Vector Rideshare and UniDash for your university, I promise you won't be disappointed!

Thanks for watching, and have a great day!
